                  The puzzle is won when all the lights are turned off. You can
                  click on a cell to toggle that light -- but it also toggles
                  the light above it, to the left of it, to the right of it and
                  below it. (Cells on an edge or in the corner won't flip as
                  many lights since they are missing some neighbors).
